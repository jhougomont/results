<p>Simulations for route planning and breaching in Phase I involved the
development of a simulation map created by fusing different layers of
data together into a single image. For current simulations, each pixel
of the simulation map represents a 1 meter by 1 meter area. Figure 4
shows the layers that are fused for the simulation risk-map.</p>

<p>The Phase I minefield prediction algorithm applies mine type and
positional information (in practice, sensor detection data) to produce a
final gridded mine risk-map (simulation map). Each grid cell has a
probability that a mine strike may occur. The risk probability is one in
the proximity radius of standard mines and zero outside of it. For
top-attack mines, a maximum detection range and a launch attack range is
specified. Within the detection range, the risk is non-zero but not one,
while within the launch range, the risk is one everywhere. The mine risk
is described further in the section about minefield types below. Figure
5 displays the radii for two overlapping top-attack mines. Regions
colored in yellow are within the detection radius and regions shaded in
red are within the attack radius. Note the region of overlap between the
two mines, the red color demonstrates the increase in risk due to the
vicinity of the two mines.</p>
<p>For a given path P traversing any grid cells <span

class="math inline">\(x_{2}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(x_{3}\)</span>, …<span
class="math inline">\(x_{n}\)</span>, on the map, the total probability
of encountering a mine can be calculated as <strong>path-risk
R(P)</strong> <strong>=</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{1
-}\prod_{\mathbf{i}}^{}{\mathbf{(1 -}\mathbf{p}_{\mathbf{i}}\left(
\mathbf{x} \right)\mathbf{)}}\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(p_{i}\)</span> is the probability of mine-strike
in grid x. <strong>R(P)</strong> is a cost that the route planning
algorithm minimizes, the overall mine-encounter risk when traversing a
path. Additional constraints such as time or distance minimization are
also included in calculating the overall cost of traversing any given
path.</p>
<h3 id="data-sources-measurement-error">Data Sources’ Measurement
Error</h3>
<p>Measurement error and differing qualities of data sources are major
factors to consider when setting up the simulations as bad quality data
leads to errors in geo-registration (Figure 6). Pre-processing the data
before geo-registration is necessary for simulation accuracy, especially
as different types of GIS data are added and accounted for.</p>
<p>A related factor to consider for simulation accuracy is a data
source’s time of collection. When using two different data sources for
different aspects of a simulation, if they were collected on different
dates, it is possible that one source accounts for a structure or road
that the other does not.</p>

</ol>
<p>The A* family of algorithms are all edge-restricted path planners
based on the Dijkstra algorithm (Figure 3). All will start at an initial
node (grid location) and iteratively visit neighboring nodes as allowed
by the defined environment (gridded gameboard). The individual and total
path cost is incrementally updated, as the cost to visit each node
starting from the initial position. The optimal path to the end node is
discovered in this process, if the environment allows it (i.e., no
obstacles fully occluding access from the start to end node). The
improvements in the newer approaches focus on compute optimization and
the addition of different constraints to vary obstacle costs, enforce
smooth paths, etc. The A* (Graph Search) algorithms are the best choice
for developing a baseline for AI-Routes mine breacher and route
planning. The algorithms’ architecture facilitates the use of distinct
data (grid) layers in the design process, allowing for easy extension of
path constraints or breacher and mine capabilities. The algorithms are
deterministic, supporting interpretability of the ML modeling
(Explainable AI), and the results in a given environment are both
optimal and complete (Table 1) [10].</p>

<p><img src="./media/image8.png"
style="width:4.90903in;height:2.04236in" class="center"/>
<p>CSLabs, using the A* approach as a baseline, developed a prototype
algorithm for AI-Routes that calculates the optimal path and breacher
firing patterns. The A* pathfinding was modified to interact with
objects on the gameboard, particularly mine types. Consequently,
applying object properties to the gameboard grid, provides the path
finding algorithms with relative distance and position information from
any node, in a manner that is computationally efficient.</p>
<p>While the A* approach by itself provides an optimal path, the
combination of mine states (armed/disarmed) and paths is a combinatoric
problem; where every mine state (armed/disarmed) represents a possible
permutation. Figure 7 demonstrates this. Node 1 is the optimal path with
no mines, and every branch that follows represents a permutation with
active mines. Each level L (0..4), represents a path decision and each
left going branch (even numbered) represents a mine group that is
breached, while the right going branch (odd numbered) represents a mine
group that is not breached, thus an alternate path around the mine group
must be found. Each mine group is a set of one-to-many mines that are
co-located and must be removed from the path for a tank to traverse the
current path-under-test (PUT). Each node greater than 1 is a decision
point. For example, if the set of mine encounters is only four levels
deep as seen in the figure, then PUT progression 1-2-4-8-16 gives the
path where all mines are removed from the optimal path. In this case,
the optimal path is identical to the path with no mines (node 1). At the
other extreme, PUT progression 1-3-7-15-31 represents the path that
avoids all mines (if such a path exists) and no mine breachers are
expended. To test all possible options, in the worst-case scenario, the
total number of paths N for all permutations to a given level L is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[N = 2^{L + 1} - 1.\]</span></p>
<p>N total simulations would need to be performed to find all
combinations of path-mine options available. This is clearly an
intractable problem if not bound, of order O(<span
class="math inline">\(2^{L}\)</span>), where L will be proportional to
the total number of mines. Fortunately, the problem is reducible in
several ways. Firstly, the mines are grouped spatially to reduce the
total number of levels (tree depth). The individual branches that form
may be pruned based on threshold criteria, such as maximum path length,
total mines breached, path difficulty, etc. Unnecessary branches are
limited by utilizing path similarity metrics. The spatial domain is
further decomposed, when necessary, to limit the depth of successive
branches. This recasts the problem as a series of O(<span
class="math inline">\(2^{\rho}\)</span>) problems, where ρ is
proportionate to the average count of mine groups in the decomposed
regions and is much less than the total mine groups.</p>
<p>The described approach with minimal computational optimizations
completes all permutations on the order of minutes with the current test
cases of size 1 km x 1 km at one meter resolution, tested on a modern i7
six core laptop. The design of this baseline algorithm is embarrassingly
parallel, so processing is easily split across multiple processors with
minimal cost, yielding speed increases proportional to the number of
cores available. Additional optimizations are expected to improve
performance by factors of 10x-100x.</p>
<p>In Phase II development, the existing capability will support the
training of supervised AI learning algorithms to further improve route
and breacher planning.</p>
<h3 id="route-breacher-system-algorithms">Route Breacher System
Algorithms</h3>
<p>In Phase I, the breachers are modeled as mobile objects with
configurable parameters. Top down breachers are modeled using the
following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Position (latitude, longitude)</p></li>
<li><p>Total rounds</p></li>
<li><p>Range in meters</p></li>
<li><p>Targeting rules</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The position can be set to remain fixed for the simulation, or the
breacher can move with the path predictions. Alternate position rulesets
can be added as required in Phase II. The total rounds that the breacher
can launch and the maximum range of effectiveness are configurations set
by the user at run-time. Finally, targeting rules for the breacher are
implemented by adding constraints such as local obstruction heights and
other physical limitations. The breacher accesses other grid layers
(such as DEM or building information) to determine whether the target is
obstructed. When the target (mine) is obstructed, then the breacher is
ineffective and the mine is not removed.</p>
<h3 id="minefield-types">Minefield Types</h3>
<p><img src="./media/image12.png"
style="width:4in;height:1.54808in" class="center"/>Several types of mines were modeled
in the simulations, all of which were anti-tank mines. In the future,
anti-personnel mines may be modeled as well depending on simulation
scenarios and customer feedback. The standard mine used was the TM-62M
mine, an anti-tank blast mine which consists of a circular metal case
and utilizes a pressure-activated fuze for detonation. This is the most
commonly found variant in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict [2]. There are
other fuses that can be used with this mine that are vibration or
magnetic sensitive. These mines were given a five-meter radius in the
simulation to account for safe standoff distance when creating paths
around them. The mine variables such as the radius are parametrized and
easily updated.</p>
<p>Two other types of mines modeled in the simulations include the
PTKM-1R and M93 Hornet. Both mines use a top-attack munition and find
their targets using various sensors. The PTKM-1R mine uses seismic and
thermal sensors [2] while the M93 Hornet uses seismic, acoustic, and
infrared sensors. For the purposes of simulation, the PTKM-1R was of
interest, but there was limited information available, so the M93 Hornet
information was used in some decisions about modeling the PTKM-1R, given
the mines’ similarities. One such decision was location of mine
placement. As shown in Figure 8, the M93 Hornet is to be placed a
certain distance from obstructions. These same rules were used for
placing the PTKM-1R. For sensor ranges, the M93 Hornet can find targets
up to 100 meters away while different sources give different ranges for
the PTKM-1R. One source says that it has a range of up to 50 meters [4].
Another source puts its range between 200 to 300 meters [2]. For the
sake of simulation, 100 meters was used as the detection radius, the
bounds in which path risk starts to increase (since a launch is possible
after detection), and 50 meters was used as the danger radius, the
bounds in which the path risk is maximum (a launch is imminent). As
mines are parameterized in AI-Routes, these numbers can be adjusted as
needed. The risk probabilities have not been well studied, so the
modeling is parametrized for easy future updates. The current risk as a
function of distance from the mine is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(r) = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
1,\ \ r &lt; r_{l} = 50m \\
e^{- \frac{{r - r_{l}}^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}},\ r_{l} \leq r \leq r_{d} =
100m \\
0,\ \ r &gt; r_{d}, \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ \]</span></p>
<p>Where r<sub>l</sub> is the launch radius, r<sub>d</sub> is the
detection radius, and σ is a free parameter used to adjust how quickly
the risk monotonically drops as the distance from r<sub>l</sub>
increases.</p>
<h3 id="path-cost-calculations">Path Cost Calculations</h3>
<p>Leveraging the AI-Routes layered grid architecture, the development
of mine and mine breacher entities are abstracted as objects, which
independently contribute to a distinct input layer of the A* algorithm
that modifies path cost; each layer is used in the <strong>(route) cost
function</strong> f(n) that is evaluated for every grid position ‘n’ in
the path and is the total cost to reach that grid position. f(n) is the
linear combination of the <strong>actual path-cost</strong> g(n) from
the start grid node to the current node and <strong>estimated
path-cost</strong> h(n), typically measured as the L1 or L2 norm from
current node to the target final grid position.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(n) = W_{g}g(n) +
W_{h}h(n)\]</span></p>
<p>g(n) incorporates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>path cost</p></li>
<li><p>mine risk</p></li>
<li><p>terrain difficulty</p></li>
<li><p>obstacle cost</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The obstacle cost can represent an object that must be circumvented
(e.g. buildings), or removable obstacles that may be crashed through,
but as a penalty in the cost function. Additional cost metrics can be
added easily, due to the layered grid design of the data
organization.</p>
<p>The weights that determine the importance of each cost term are given
by <span class="math inline">\(W_{g}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(W_{h}\)</span>, where:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{g} + W_{h} = 1.\]</span></p>
<p>For example, if <span class="math inline">\(W_{h} \ll W_{g}\)</span>,
then the paths preferred will not focus on the shortest possible
distance to the goal. The path cost g(n) can also be modified to use
path history (dynamic) information. The cost function may be modified
for kinematic conditions at the current node, for example, variables
such as path derivatives may be used to reduce sharp turns that a tank
may not make.</p>
<h3 id="path-selection">Path Selection</h3>
<p>Path selection is straight forward matter of determining the overall
metrics that are considered most important. The current metrics
tracked:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Path length</p></li>
<li><p>Path risk</p></li>
<li><p>Path difficulty</p></li>
<li><p>Mine breached.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Phase I, the top results presented were paths with minimum overall
distance, risk, difficulty, and mines breached. This search was
implemented as a sort and select procedure. The family of paths output
are each optimal for the selection of mines and obstacles avoided, but
variation in risk, difficulty, and total mines breached allows fine
tuning of the preferred path based on reduction of risk, total breacher
rounds, or other constraints. The output paths are sorted in ascending
order according to the primary metric of interest, then the top results
are sorted for secondary metrics. For example, if minimizing the
distance traveled is most important, then path length is the primary
metric, and the secondary metric that is minimized is path risk. Other
metrics further minimized may be total mines breached. The order of this
process begins with the most valued metric and the subset is reduced
based on the secondary constraints. The top paths are output to the user
for visual inspection.</p>

Scenarios</h3></li>

</ol>
<p>The first simulation scenarios were developed to understand and test
algorithm results (Figure 9). <strong>Scenario 1</strong> gives a
limited set of allowable paths to ensure the algorithm is working as
intended. It includes a road with a conventional AT mine and a couple of
top-attack AT mines. <strong>Scenario 2</strong> tests a two-row field
of top-attack mines (like the PTKM-1R or Hornet) with a fence and road
going through it. The offroad region in this scenario is traversable,
albeit, at a higher path cost which will increase the path difficulty if
taken. These scenarios are handmade scenarios not based on any
real-world GIS data. In both scenarios, there are no paths that can
completely avoid mines without breacher rounds. The conventional AT
mines in all scenarios use a danger radius of five meters (which acts as
the required safe standoff distance for a path to go around it). The
top-attack AT mines in all scenarios use an outer radius of 100 meters
with an inner (launch) radius of 50 meters. The risk increases from the
outer radius to the inner radius. A path cannot go within the radius of
conventional AT mines or within the inner radius of a top-attack mine as
that is considered too high of a risk.</p>

style="width:6.21748in;height:3.49471in" class="center"/></p>
<p>Simulation results for <strong>scenario 1</strong> (Figure 10) show
that the modified A* algorithm successfully found all four possible
successful path-breacher configurations. Path 6 minimizes path length
and risk and results in the use of three breacher rounds to clear the
path. Path 4 minimizes the use of breacher rounds but increases the path
risk since the path goes within the outer (detection) radius of the
top-attack mine but remains outside the inner (launch) radius; the path
risk accumulates according to the length of the path inside the
detection radius. Paths 4 and 9 avoid the inner radius of the top-attack
mines by taking the longer path to get to the path endpoint. Higher path
difficulty in paths 1 and 4 are a result of the paths going slightly
offroad to avoid active mines.</p>

<p><img src="./media/image19.png"
style="width:3.87742in;height:4.36655in" class="center"/></p>
<p>Results for <strong>scenario 2</strong> (Figure 11) show three
optimal paths: minimized path length, minimized breacher rounds used,
and a best overall minimization of path risk, difficulty, and mines
breached. Path 340 neutralizes four mines and travels straight through
on the road. Path 215 maintains low risk by neutralizing three mines and
then tracing a path around the 100-meter perimeter of remaining mines.
Finally, path 3 has higher risk but only utilizes one breacher round and
reduces risk as much as possible by tracing a path between two 100-meter
mine perimeters and maximizing distance from a third active mine.
Furthermore, path difficulty is increased on this path by the need to
crash through the fence and travel on more difficult offroad terrain. It
should also be noted that the path risk score accumulates from distance
traveled within the 100-meter perimeter of the active mines.</p>

<h3 id="urban-scenario-using-gis-data">Urban Scenario Using GIS
Data</h3>
<p><img src="./media/image24.png"
style="width:3.84167in;height:2.12986in" class="center"/>For this and subsequent
scenarios, GIS tools were used to retrieve geo-registered data for
creating simulations at real-world locations, including DEM data (Figure
12). The simulation map for this scenario is a fusion of street map data
including roads, parking lots, buildings, and other large structures
(Figure 13).</p>
<p>Both conventional and top-attack AT mines were placed throughout the
scene. The start point for the path is in the upper-left corner of the
map and the goal end point is by a building in the south-central region
of the map.</p>
<p><img src="./media/image26.png"
style="width:3.52629in;height:4.66424in" class="center"/></p>
<p>As with the initial scenarios, running simulations for this urban
environment results in path options that best minimize different metrics
(Figure 14). Path 189 shows the path that minimizes breacher round usage
to only three by tracing the perimeter of an active top-attack mine
until it needs to go into its 100-meter perimeter to go around a
building, quickly leaving the perimeter of the active mine when
possible. Path 493 minimizes path risk and difficulty, but uses the most
breacher rounds, neutralizing ten mines. It takes the most direct path
through the streets taking out any mines that are in that direct path.
Path 463 balances minimizing path risk and breacher rounds while taking
a path that is just slightly more difficult.</p>

<h3 id="kyiv-urban-scenario-using-gis-data">Kyiv Urban Scenario Using
GIS Data</h3>
<p>Following direction from C5ISR during the meeting on January
23<sup>rd</sup>, 2023, the focus was shifted to simulating the types of
scenarios and situations that are likely to become relevant to the
United States given the current geopolitical climate. To that end, the
next two scenarios focus on environments that may be found in the
Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p>The first of the two scenarios is an urban map built from GIS data of
a 1 km x 1 km area in the city of Kyiv (Figure 15). The starting point
is in the southwestern portion of the map and the endpoint is by a large
building in the northeast portion of the map. This iteration of the
simulation engine also allows for parameterizing the breacher system.
The breacher, in this case, is placed at the same location as the start
point for the path and has a range of 1 km, which gives it range to
neutralize mines throughout the entire simulation map. As with all the
other scenarios, both conventional and top-attack mines were placed
throughout the scene. During discussions about this scenario at the
bi-monthly meeting on March 6<sup>th</sup>, 2023, the customer indicated
that it would be unlikely for top-attack mines to be used in an urban
environment as there would be concern about other structures in the area
setting off the mine besides intended targets. Since these simulations
were made before that discussion, there are top-attack mines present in
the scenario. In future simulations of this or similar scenarios, those
mines can be removed and replaced with more conventional AT mines.</p>
<p><img src="./media/image31.png"
style="width:3.41347in;height:3.81882in" class="center"/></p>
<p>Path 298 from this simulation shows a path that avoids having to
neutralize any mines but has a higher path risk and much higher path
difficulty than the other optimal paths. The path achieves this by
weaving through and around buildings on offroad paths. It is important
to note that the pathfinding algorithm does not currently account for a
minimum width of the path so portions of the path involve spaces that
are three to four meters in width whereas a ten meter width of clearance
would be required in reality as per discussions in customer meetings on
January 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2023, and March 6<sup>th</sup>, 2023. This is
something that will be addressed in future iterations of AI-Routes and
is discussed further in section ‎3.5. Paths 3676 and 3524 are similar,
with 3676 minimizing breacher usage and 3524 minimizing path difficulty
(Figure 16). An interesting note about these paths is that near the
beginning of the paths, both paths take a turn onto a smaller road and
then turn back onto the main road. It would make more sense to just go
straight through the main road. This anomaly is a result of the A*
algorithm heuristic cost function, in that the pathfinding always tends
towards the direction of the endpoint of the path. This may be improved
by tweaking path “weight” parameters or adding smoothness constraints.
Secondary path processing can also be applied since the “main” optimal
path has been found and only requires minor smoothing which can be done
independent of the primary cost optimizations.</p>

<h3 id="kyiv-ruralforested-scenario-using-gis-data">Kyiv Rural/Forested
Scenario Using GIS Data</h3>
<p>The last scenario that was developed during Phase I was a 1.7 km x
1.7 km region of forest and a small part of a village that is
north-northwest of Kyiv (Figure 17). The starting point for this is in
the southwest corner of the map, and the ending point is in the
north-central part of the map on a road that goes over a stream/river.
Conventional AT mines were placed at intersections to block roads that
lead to the village. Top-attack mines were placed along the road that
runs along the south side of the village to deny entry into the village.
The breacher system is co-located with the starting point.</p>
<p><img src="./media/image36.png"
style="width:3.41347in;height:3.81882in" class="center"/></p>
<p>For the first simulation results of this scenario (Figure 18), the
breacher was given a large enough range to neutralize any mines on the
map. Path 580 minimizes the use of breacher rounds, neutralizing only
five mines including one top-attack mine and four conventional AT mines.
The path taken is the most direct to the objective endpoint. It travels
through the row of top-attack mines avoiding getting too far into the
perimeters of the adjacent mines to reduce risk as much as possible and
then goes around the road to avoid a group of AT mines at the end. Path
2587 takes the same route as path 580 but neutralizes more of the
top-attack mines to minimize the path risk. Path 44366 is like path 2587
except that it also destroys the AT mines on the road at the end to
minimize path difficulty and risk while using the most breachers.</p>
<p><img src="./media/image38.png"

alt="Table Description automatically generated" class="center"/></p>
<p><img src="./media/image39.png"
style="width:5.88265in;height:6.30208in" class="center"/></p>
<p>The second set of simulation results for this scenario gives the
breacher a limited range of 1 km (Figure 19). This limits its ability to
take out mines at the end of the path. Path 82 is like path 580 from the
previous set of paths except that it destroys a different set of mines
in the forest road intersection. For the conventional AT mines at the
end, the path is forced to go around them since the breacher cannot
reach these mines.</p>

<h2 id="mine-placement-tool-proof-of-concept">Mine Placement Tool
Proof-of-Concept</h2>
<p>During Phase I, following a suggestion made after the second
bi-monthly meeting, CSLabs developed a proof-of-concept tool for placing
mines in a scene from a graphical user interface (Figure 20). This tool
will aid in research as it facilitates setting up different minefield
configurations for simulation and may have future utility for
end-users.</p>

<p>The current proof-of-concept tool gives the user the ability to load
in up to two different geo-registered maps of a region and then place or
remove individual mines from the scene. If two maps are loaded, they can
be toggled between at any time (Figure 21). This makes it possible for
the user to visualize the scene in different ways that may aid in mine
placement. The user can also adjust the mine parameters that will be
used for simulation and toggle the display of the detection and danger
radii which update in real-time as the parameters are adjusted (Figure
22). Finally, the mine placement can be exported to a text file that can
be parsed by the simulation component of AI-Routes. That exported file
can be reloaded back into the mine placement tool for further
editing.</p>
